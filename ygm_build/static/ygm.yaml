       The Cocktail Gang gets "Wild Again" as we set off on a new podtail... or should
       we say "pod tale"! After all, we have a Whale of a Story to share with
       you: the story of brash, young, scared military man Brian Flanagan and his
       dreams of owning the city of New York, one spinning bottle of liquor at a
       time. New features are debuted: "Drink of the Ep", "Flair in the Air", and
       "Who Let the Spoilers Out?". We pick apart the film’s depiction of
       masculinity in the 1980s, fill you in on the latest news and gossip about
       Gilles Gothic, examine the roots of George W. Bush’s imperialist aims, and
       check up on your favorite Long Island City subway stops. As we’ve always
       said, there has to be a crossroad, a place to draw the line. And as
       always, we attempt to answer the question, "what is theirs and what is
       mine?" The answer may surprise you.

     cocktail:
       name: The Uncle Pat
       image: http://media.earfulofconvoy.com/earful/drink_img/cocktail_drink_01.jpg
       recipe: |
         1.5 oz potcheen
         2 oz flat beer through rusty pipes
         0.5 oz grenadine

         Carve a dollar sign into rind of half a lime and garnish

         Served on the rocks in double old-fashioned glass.

             Beer prepared by leaving out two ounces of lowest grade beer at hand (Corona)
             to go flat for an hour, metallic taste aided by the addition of four pennies (which
             hopefully also contributed the kind of gunk that doubtless clings to every
             inch of Pat's Tavern). Ice added first, grenadine glopped on top, which
             immediately sunk to bottom. Lime was initially halved, then carved into with
             dollar sign, then squeezed to completion (juice discarded), finally put in an toaster
             oven for a few minutes. Nothing was stirred.

             The nose reeked of potcheen's weird melon-like funk. The first sip
             stung with sour and intense potcheen kick, evoking
             spoiled dairy and antiseptic, mellowed with the stale beer's texture of a
             stagnant creek. It's the kind of drink a Pat's Cavern patron would
             love, the punishing sort of drink that makes you feel that you
             *earned* your insobriety, and keeps you safe from the troubling
             notion that you may for a moment ever enjoy your life. The
             grenadine only comes into play late in the drink. At this point,
             all you have is the remainder of the ice, an overlarge lime rind,
             and the grenadine you never wanted in the first place. You indifferently
             try to sip it for a while, but eventually dump it out.

             From rusty pipes come terrible drinks. Potcheen should not be in
             anything. The Uncle Pat is bad.

        Outwork, outthink, outscheme, and outmanoeuvre: that's the strategy for the
        Cocktail Gang as we address the second five, as Brian Flanagan pursues other
        avenues and wears many ties.  We are introduced to the first of Coughlin’s
        Laws, and hear the chilling name of "McDougall" for the first time. A lot
        happens during this episode: the psychology of Uncle Pat is delved, logical
        positivism is assessed, and we even start a lawsuit! Along the way, we attempt
        to solve the mystery once and for all: did the Mets win the World Series in
        1969 or 1965? The movie "Cocktail" offers clues. New feature: "Coughlin’s
        Laws."

             For the record, it is *not* possible to slice atomic fireball candy.

             In capturing the airy lustrousness of the gray Manhattan interview
             rooms, Stoli was selected, which seemed to be adequately '80s
             glitzy. As someone who does not like vodka cocktails and does not
             like apple juice, it's uncanny how *good* this is―almost certainly
             the best drink of its kind. Both the apple juice and pernod swim
             faintly against the big nothingness of vodka and seltzer; strong
             flavors in small quantities, it gives you the impression of a noisy
             street-level hubbub wafting 30 floors up, at the threshold of
             audibility. (The apple in particular gives the drink a certain
             honest bulkiness.) As you make you way through, the outer layer of
             the atomic fireball dissolves, lending an unsubtle satire of the
             cutthroat business world: stick around long enough and you're
             ankle-deep in blood.

             I don't like vodka cocktails much but this one was OK. More subtle
             than expected. For best results let it sit a day until the Atomic

        An episode with all the excitement of the Keynesian revolution... but

        matriculation to the University of Toronto. He's slipping and sliding
        behind the bar, scoring big tips from the waitstaff and BIGGER tips

             In designing the perfect TGI Fridays-style cocktail, it's important to balance
             two necessary subcomponents: the actual cocktail itself (comprising
             the essential substance of the drink) and the corporate-mandated
             elements (comprising gimmick, spectacle, and profit). Let's quickly
             dispense with the former concern: the Ding-A-Ling is a solid
             cocktail. The hazy licorice smell initially pervades, eventually
             subsiding into soft cream, then souring subtly into shades of harsh
             coffee and sweet. Essentially a White Russian with tuned-down base
             spirit and tuned-up cacao and anise, the Ding-A-Ling is a can't miss
             sort of concoction that we knocked out of the park. Soft and spicy,
             rich and mysterious, I can recommend it without reservation.

             Technically, the drink is something of a mess, for several
             reasons. Sprinkles: the sort of can't-miss gimmick that one would
             see everywhere in the T.G.I.sphere if they worked. They do not.
             For each sprinkle that successfully rests atop the cream, ten or
             twenty sink immediately.  Sprinkles do not demonstrably add to the
             presentation of the drink, and they do not demonstrably add to the
             flavor. The gimmick with the vodka-soaked Twizzler is not
             worth the awkward process of the soak, and Twizzler-balancing within
             the cocktail glass without it buckling and collapsing into the center
             was an impossibility. Finally, the cherry sank like a stone, not
             to be seen again; simply wasted. A fair amount of work was done
             trying to balance the cherry against the Twizzler, but it's not
             doable in a reasonable amount of time, certainly not the amount of
             time available to a harried Friday's bartender. Upon finishing the
             drink, the customer is left with an unappetizing layer of gunk.

             With a proper R&D budget, TGI Fridays may be able to design a proper glass
             to allow the ambitious vision of the Ding-A-Ling to function as intended.

             At first, cream. Fluffy, creamy coffee cream. Then a brutal awakening — the
             violent intrusion of licorice brought by an unfortunate quantity of Ouzo.

             It's fair to say there's balance here.

             There's no way to happily attend the funeral of Tom Cruise, but at
             least one can sip the proper cocktail while weeping. This drink shares
             some similarities to drinking "Remy Martin, neat", with several key departures:

             1) There are sprinkles floating in it|
             2) The glass is very big

             The sprinkles, somewhat surprisingly, blossom with great majesty into an
             inky cloud within seconds. Not only contributing to the atmosphere of
             mourning, this also adds to the taste of the spicy rich deep bloomy
             cognac, adding a note of sour. Also, the sprinkles are chewy.

             The large glass helps direct everything directly to the nose and
             face, targeting the mulchy spiciness into the sinuses and also
             presenting a miniature comfortable world to fall into, as one stares
             into the bottom of the very large snifter. Other see you as carrying
             a deep and somber reminder of loss, while you discover a deep and
             rich world for into escape.

             Alas, Finnegan, ye shall be missed. Rémy Martin is enjoyable. Even moreso with
             spooky sprinkles. The large snifter really impresses upon you the alcoholic
             aroma of the drink. A modest effort here.

           review: >
             For such a simple cocktail―only two ingredients, no ice, no fuss―everything
             went awry surprisingly quickly.  Without a complete explanation of the subtle
             chemistry at play, I can only report that a careful pour of the Everclear into
             the pint glass of Soylent led the the glass to *roar*: weird and deeply angry
             rolls of geyserlike discontent. It was immediately apparent that drinking the
             Silicon Valley Dirty Lyle would not be a calming experience.

             A problem was immediately visible: thin clear pools gathering upon the surface
             of the drink showed that the two ingredients had separated (with the pure
             alcohol atop).  As a result, the first sip was maximally intense, yet one could
             still detect the Soylent within it: crisp pancake against bright pricks of
             fire. The tongue was tossed about, the alcohol activating the tip while the
             heavy Soylent dominated the sides and back.

             The drinker continued to sip carefully and unenthusiastically, each sip less
             jaunty than the one before. Before very long, a dullness set in. A morning
             brightness soon dampened into midday beige, the cocktail uncannily simulates
             the experience of an alcoholic's whole day. By this time, the experience had
             become a chore: lukewarm and distinctly unrefreshing, far too much and then far
             too little.

             The chore langoured well after finishing the drink: dead-eyed at the sink, one
             notes a powdery coat of grime on the glass that resists all scrubbing, while at
             the same time a slightly nutritious coat clings unpleasantly to the back of the
             throat.

           review: >
             As it turns out, when you have two liquids of vastly different densities, one
             of them is prone to rise to the top. This means that the Everclear quickly and
             persistently rises above the (much less dense) Soylent, effectively resulting
             in an Everclear float.

             An Everclear float is a very bad thing to have in your drink.

             Once you get past the float, the rest of the drink is just Soylent. Soylent is
             fine, but I prefer it colder and with more chocolate.

             I cannot recommend the SVDL.

               A pretty drink for pretty yuppies; it wows upon first glance
               with its emerald tones and partially-plastic bouquet. Though one
               knows that the content will prove false―precisely the point with
               such a yuppie gimmick―it impresses at first, coming in smooth with
               clean neon edges. But as per the yuppie lifestyle, as soon as you
               commit to it, the harshness is upon you. Cough syrup
               bright, wave after aqua wave of a Sharkleberry Finn immediacy, it's
               really too much to stand, too ersatz to consume quickly, and
               quite overbearingly loud. One is quickly convinced to renounce yuppieism
               and plan the jailbreak. Late, late in the drink, long after
               reckoning and regret, the actual taste emerges: copper and grain.

              This drink is a feast for the eyes, if not always the tongue. It
              has three phases:

              1) An initial rise of tempered sweetness, not unintriguing|
              2) An overwhelming spike of sickening syrup|
              3) A mellowing out into a slightly bitter finish

              The evolution of it over these phases is interesting and worth
              experiencing. While phase 2 does undercut the overall appeal of
              the drink, I found phase 1 and 3 to be pretty palatable. The
              peach schnapps shines throughout, making the drink a lot more
              approachable than it would be otherwise.

              Visually, the drink is absolutely stunning.

         2.0 oz gin
         1.0 oz lemon juice
         0.25 oz grenadine

         black Jell-O.

         Optionally garnish with cinnamon stick.

           review: >
             I'm skeptical of foods and drinks that are good when hot, but bad
             at room temperature, like coffee or McNuggets. That said, hot
             toddies are always a winner. The Angry Basketball is a spin on the
             classic winter night's drink, transforming into a drink for summer
             at noonday, to be downed in sweaty and uncomfortable moods.

             It has the lemony nose of a hot toddy when coming in, in the mouth
             a delicate fabric of light and soft citrus flavors, washing into
             Kool-Aid, bright and gummy. For within mere seconds, the tidy
             sharp-edged cube had completely dissolved, becoming a murky layer
             of ink. This gummy artificiality (nothing in nature looks like
             this) makes it a chore to work all the way through. Soft and
             sticky, sublimated anger, but the heat makes it bearable.

             The cinnamon stick was not meant to be optional, and we had
             cinnamon sticks prepared. We just screwed up, and it's too bad,
             because cinnamon would have fixed many of these problems.

             I never tasted the gin for a moment.
         - reviewer: Alan Joyce
           review: >
             If nothing else, let it be said that we utterly succeeded in
             making a coral-colored drink. Somehow the lemon juice + grenadine
             + clear liquid combo results in a perfect coral drink.

             Beyond the color, there's something fairly special here. As the
             Jell-O cubes dissolve, the drink goes from rather sour to slightly
             sweet. Adding extra hot water while drinking both helps this
             process and improves the overall drinking experience.

             I'm not a huge fan of Jell-O, especially the aggressively
             artificial flavor of grape Jell-O, but it does help to balance
             this drink and watching it dissolve is quite satisfying.

             Overall, this is a drinkable effort with some positive qualities.
