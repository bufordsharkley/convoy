       We depart Long Island and head to The Big Apple to start our new movie,

       lengthy credit sequence, featuring God's Desktop, and explore the
       beginnings of the downfall of Western Civilization. Featuring new
       segments, "You've Got Spoilers," "Hack of the Ep," and "'Ware in the
       Air".

       Get ready for cameos! Joe finishes the juice, Patricia poses for the
       mags, and everybody zigs and zags to to the Cranberries (peak 1990s).
       Time for emails about enjoying emails, some good tips on learning Latin
       like a Local, some real-time mapping of Manhattan businesses, and some
       Gant charting!

       The novel coronavirus cannot keep the Earful gang down! Like Tom Hanks,
       we've risen from the dead; a little rusty, but with plenty of new
       CDC-approved protocol for keeping the YGM analysis both incisive and
       safe. In this ep, we bring you a veritable "Who's Who" from the Fox
       family tree, say hello to New Jersey, and give careful ratings of all
       "games" at the Fall Festival. Also featuring the popular new segment
       "Our Set-Up."

       Two grand openings this week: Fox and Sons Books, and Episode 06 of An
       Earful of You've Got Mail! As the Fox surveys the henhouse, Kathleen
       and George practice the hard sell, Christina moves the fish, and sandwichman
       chows down. Meanwhile, we analyze book prices (hand-tipped or non), plow
       through 5+ sub-scenes, create synergy among our various podcast properties,
       and generally do the best we can, given that we cannot hear
       each other speak.

        It's a hit! The Earful Gang is back with episode seven, and it's even
        more fun than the nut shop! It's party time at Vince Mancini's, and we
        have plenty of time to talk about rent control, Miranda rights, the
        books Miranda writes, as well as the legendary William Spungeon. (Isn't
        he in Mexico?) So step to the back of the drink line and listen in!
        (Also featuring the hit segment "We Check the Tweets")
