       We depart Long Island and head to The Big Apple to start our new movie,
       "You've Got Mail"; the earful gang immediately get started through a
       lengthy credit sequence, featuring God's Desktop, and explore the
       beginnings of the downfall of Western Civilization. Featuring new
       segments, "You've Got Spoilers," "Hack of the Ep," and "'Ware in the

       mags, and everybody zigs and zags to to the Cranberries (peak 1990s).
       Time for emails about enjoying emails, some good tips on learning Latin
       like a Local, some real-time mapping of Manhattan businesses, and some
       Gant charting!

       The novel coronavirus cannot keep the Earful gang down! Like Tom Hanks,
       we've risen from the dead; a little rusty, but with plenty of new
       CDC-approved protocol for keeping the YGM analysis both incisive and
       safe. In this ep, we bring you a veritable "Who's Who" from the Fox
       family tree, say hello to New Jersey, and give careful ratings of all
       "games" at the Fall Festival. Also featuring the popular new segment
       "Our Set-Up."

       Two grand openings this week: Fox and Sons Books, and Episode 06 of An
       Earful of You've Got Mail! As the Fox surveys the henhouse, Kathleen
       and George practice the hard sell, Christina moves the fish, and sandwichman
       chows down. Meanwhile, we analyze book prices (hand-tipped or non), plow
       through 5+ sub-scenes, create synergy among our various podcast properties,
       and generally do the best we can, given that we cannot hear
       each other speak.

        more fun than the nut shop! It's party time at Vince Mancini's, and we
        have plenty of time to talk about rent control, Miranda rights, the
        books Miranda writes, as well as the legendary William Spungeon. (Isn't
        he in Mexico?) So step to the back of the drink line and listen in!

       veritable smorgasbord of savory morsels on display today: we analyze the
       egg dish, judge the poultry lift, and assess garnishes. And as always, we
       mix business with pleasure: analyzing the corporate structure of the Price
       Club, guessing Birdie's salary, and auditing bookstore revenues (we're in
       the book business, after all!)

       merriment: we head to the hectic, not-yet-cashfree world of Zabar's to
       introduce a new exhibit, explore the lobster salad controversy, and
       uncover the four secret steps to a perfect espresso. Educate yourself
       with a lively debate about whether 'A Christmas Carol' takes place at

       very fun) Thanksgiving Round of "The Instrument Song (The Orchestra
       Song)", Birdie is on the prowl, and we investigate the innovative
       voice-over scheme that YGM uses to represent online communication.

       In this, the final episode of Earful, the gang is in a feuding mood! We
       again return to the Happy Land of Absolutes to discuss the eleventh five
       minutes of You've Got Mail, and discuss the criminality of all the Mail
       characters, Jeffersonian purity, and modern gym wicking technology.
       Recorded just hours after the Presidential Election was called, we're also
       making our own calls: how best can an unprofitable cultural enterprise
       be preserved? Who is best suited to be the spokesman for Fox Books? And
       is Kathleen Kelly truly a pill? Featuring the famous segments "We Read
       the Tweets" and "We Relitigate the Feuds" (AKA "Feud Update" AKA "The
       Feud Litigator")

       Freshly equipped with macOS Big Sur (running beautifully), we're back
       with a new ep of An Earful of You've Got Mail! In this ep, Joe Fox is
       drunk as a skunk, the lockets are opening up, and Frank stars on
       everybody's favorite show: "**NT WAT**". We also conclude the important
       saga of William Spungeon, and rhapsodize about the ecstasy of email. 10-4!

       If you're in search of the perfect combination of poetry and meanness, look no
       further! Earful is back, and we're deep into cross-textual analysis: in
       addition to a typically incisive analysis of a YGM chunk (Joe Fox shakes a
       fence, Kathleen re-ups on tea), we crack open multiple additional texts‒first diving
       deep into the themes of Ernst Lubitsch's "The Shop Around the Corner",
       then plunging into the work of Miklós László's "Parfumerie", and finally
       reading the back cover summary of Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice".
       But don't worry: we still have plenty of time to analyze
       the chair management at Cafe Lalo's (with more detail than any other
       competing podcast). Also featuring the popular sements "We Taste-test
       Skittles Dips" and "We Write An Email" (AKA "Email Time").

       We ring in the new year with another episode of Earful: the easiest just
       got easier!  In this ep, we breach the veritable "third rail" of "You've
       Got Mail" (1998) analysis: talking about vertical service codes: *70?
       *57? *86?  They're all here! But that's not all: we crack open the
       fourteenth five minutes of the film, and ask the big questions. Did Joe
       Fox lie? Can an express train suck you onto the tracks? Is
       a "Mochaccino-land" good or bad? And: will you be mean to him, too?
       Episode features important updates about the 1998 Federal Transportation
       Reauthorization bill, as well as Hervey's Aunt Beth's memories of seeing YGM,
       and also contains the sort of core/periphery analysis you'll find nowhere
       else! (Additional segments include "Our Feud Update", AKA "Our Feud".)

       Rooftop Killer (with a-ccompaniment on live harmonica!) In these five
       minutes of film, Robert Underwood gets framed for murder (by Rudy
       Giuliani and George), Joe shows off some sick macros, and Birdie gets
       spooky. Meanwhile, we pick apart the controversy of Champion Fairewood
       Frolic (registered name or called name: which counts?), go over
       the day's news (the day being February 18, 1998), and send two emails to
       Chip Davis's publicists. And best of all: website now secure! (Also featuring

       Gang is back to analyze (eventually, be patient) the 16th five minutes
       of YGM, and it just may strain your CPU! (Send syslogs, please.) Joe Fox
       deletes up a storm (we count the keys), Intel stock is soaring (we read
       the ticker), Birdie dates fascists (we dig deep into Francoist Spain), and
       Alan turns a video into a GIF (we outline the steps)‒just watch out
       for the idle timeouts!  Also featuring the historic vindication of
       Michelle (of Terry & Michelle fame). Michelle, we're so sorry!

       in cyberspace! Joining via a chatroom-voice-to-text bridge (presented by
       Wells Fargo), Diego shares his hate of Kathleen Kelly, as we
       pick apart the 17th five
       minutes of YGM. The Shop liquidates, Frank and Kathleen part amicably, and
       the Fox fox leers lecherously; meanwhile, we analyze just *how* racist
       Kathleen is, talk about the joys of loitering at Barnes and Noble, and
       scope out the competition, as we pick apart the YGM analysis at Slate's
       "Decoder Ring." You'll have a good time, we can't help ourselves!

       we learn about the famously flawless taste of Kathleen Kelly,
       (contrasted with the piggish, disgusting ignorance of Fox Books
       employees), and dig into contingencies of elevator protocol. The

       The Shop Around the Corner is closed for good, and that means only three
       things: MOPE MOPE MOPE! Kathleen flips the Closing Sign (we introduce our
       new project "Supersonic"), and immediately becomes a femcel antinatalist.
       Meanwhile, we're Dockside Foxside at the 19th Street Boat Basin,
       conducting an intensive #BoatBarAnalysis, the softball team is
       goosestepping ominously, Matt is home alone, and the Storybook Person is

       It's June 2021, and COVID is finally over! Let's celebrate California
       being open for business, as we exit the cyberworld and have our first
       Earful back in the same room! A big episode for analysis, as Joe makes a
       Friend Request, forcibly shuts Kathleen's mouth, and enters his
       internet-capable hacker den. We complement the analysis with innovative
       fan theories and uncover mysterious book covers, as well as some... tweaking.
       Also, a heartfelt retirement from email. Featuring the popular segments
       "The Set Up", "The Feuding Section", "2008 Film Update", "Release
       Schedule", and "Pepsi Segment".

       Howdy pardner, saddle up for the "Summer of You've Got Mail"! We've got
       ourselves a heaping helping of film analysis today, with a veritable
       bounty of scenes: extras are a-loading up their oysters at the
       dear-departed Ocean Grill, the ballet of commerce is a-underway at the
       flowers market, and the styrofoam cups are a-flowing at Gray's Papaya.
       But most importantly, it's open season for vicious zings on NY152: we
       grade Joe and Kathleen's efforts, and even attempt to manufacture our
       own, in the special segment "We Come Up With Our Own NY152 Insults"
