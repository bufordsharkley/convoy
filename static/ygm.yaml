       We depart Long Island and head to The Big Apple to start our new movie,
       "You've Got Mail"; the earful gang immediately get started through a
       lengthy credit sequence, featuring God's Desktop, and explore the
       beginnings of the downfall of Western Civilization. Featuring new
       segments, "You've Got Spoilers," "Hack of the Ep," and "'Ware in the

       Get ready for cameos! Joe finishes the juice, Patricia poses for the
       mags, and everybody zigs and zags to to the Cranberries (peak 1990s).
       Time for emails about enjoying emails, some good tips on learning Latin
       like a Local, some real-time mapping of Manhattan businesses, and some
       Gant charting!

       The novel coronavirus cannot keep the Earful gang down! Like Tom Hanks,
       we've risen from the dead; a little rusty, but with plenty of new
       CDC-approved protocol for keeping the YGM analysis both incisive and
       safe. In this ep, we bring you a veritable "Who's Who" from the Fox
       family tree, say hello to New Jersey, and give careful ratings of all
       "games" at the Fall Festival. Also featuring the popular new segment
       "Our Set-Up."

       Two grand openings this week: Fox and Sons Books, and Episode 06 of An
       Earful of You've Got Mail! As the Fox surveys the henhouse, Kathleen
       and George practice the hard sell, Christina moves the fish, and sandwichman
       chows down. Meanwhile, we analyze book prices (hand-tipped or non), plow
       through 5+ sub-scenes, create synergy among our various podcast properties,
       and generally do the best we can, given that we cannot hear
       each other speak.

        It's a hit! The Earful Gang is back with episode seven, and it's even
        more fun than the nut shop! It's party time at Vince Mancini's, and we
        have plenty of time to talk about rent control, Miranda rights, the
        books Miranda writes, as well as the legendary William Spungeon. (Isn't
        he in Mexico?) So step to the back of the drink line and listen in!

       Pop an Ultra Dorm and settle in for another episode of Earful! A
       veritable smorgasbord of savory morsels on display today: we analyze the
       egg dish, judge the poultry lift, and assess garnishes. And as always, we
       mix business with pleasure: analyzing the corporate structure of the Price
       Club, guessing Birdie's salary, and auditing bookstore revenues (we're in
       the book business, after all!)

       "Press Send" to another ep of Earful, featuring plenty of holiday
       merriment: we head to the hectic, not-yet-cashfree world of Zabar's to
       introduce a new exhibit, explore the lobster salad controversy, and
       uncover the four secret steps to a perfect espresso. Educate yourself
       with a lively debate about whether 'A Christmas Carol' takes place at
       Thanksgiving or Christmas. Also introducing the popular segment "We

       You've Got... Instant Message?!?! We've kicked into Web 2.0 here at
       Earful, and the textboxes are flying! This ep, we have a delightful (and
       very fun) Thanksgiving Round of "The Instrument Song (The Orchestra
       Song)", Birdie is on the prowl, and we investigate the innovative
       voice-over scheme that YGM uses to represent online communication.
       ...Hello? Also featuring the popular segment "Our Jacobin Feud,"

       In this, the final episode of Earful, the gang is in a feuding mood! We
       again return to the Happy Land of Absolutes to discuss the eleventh five
       minutes of You've Got Mail, and discuss the criminality of all the Mail
       characters, Jeffersonian purity, and modern gym wicking technology.
       Recorded just hours after the Presidential Election was called, we're also
       making our own calls: how best can an unprofitable cultural enterprise
       be preserved? Who is best suited to be the spokesman for Fox Books? And
       is Kathleen Kelly truly a pill? Featuring the famous segments "We Read
       the Tweets" and "We Relitigate the Feuds" (AKA "Feud Update" AKA "The
       Feud Litigator")

       Freshly equipped with macOS Big Sur (running beautifully), we're back
       with a new ep of An Earful of You've Got Mail! In this ep, Joe Fox is
       drunk as a skunk, the lockets are opening up, and Frank stars on
       everybody's favorite show: "**NT WAT**". We also conclude the important
       saga of William Spungeon, and rhapsodize about the ecstasy of email. 10-4!

       If you're in search of the perfect combination of poetry and meanness, look no
       further! Earful is back, and we're deep into cross-textual analysis: in
       addition to a typically incisive analysis of a YGM chunk (Joe Fox shakes a
       fence, Kathleen re-ups on tea), we crack open multiple additional texts‒first diving
       deep into the themes of Ernst Lubitsch's "The Shop Around the Corner",
       then plunging into the work of Miklós László's "Parfumerie", and finally
       reading the back cover summary of Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice".
       But don't worry: we still have plenty of time to analyze
       the chair management at Cafe Lalo's (with more detail than any other
       competing podcast). Also featuring the popular sements "We Taste-test
       Skittles Dips" and "We Write An Email" (AKA "Email Time").

     description: >
       We ring in the new year with another episode of Earful: the easiest just
       got easier!  In this ep, we breach the veritable "third rail" of "You've
       Got Mail" (1998) analysis: talking about vertical service codes: *70?
       *57? *86?  They're all here! But that's not all: we crack open the
       fourteenth five minutes of the film, and ask the big questions. Did Joe
       Fox lie? Can an express train suck you onto the tracks? Is
       a "Mochaccino-land" good or bad? And: will you be mean to him, too?
       Episode features important updates about the 1998 Federal Transportation
       Reauthorization bill, as well as Hervey's Aunt Beth's memories of seeing YGM,
       and also contains the sort of core/periphery analysis you'll find nowhere
       else! (Additional segments include "Our Feud Update", AKA "Our Feud".)

       Gather round, and you shall hear the Earful Gang sing The Ballad of the
       Rooftop Killer (with a-ccompaniment on live harmonica!) In these five
       minutes of film, Robert Underwood gets framed for murder (by Rudy
       Giuliani and George), Joe shows off some sick macros, and Birdie gets
       spooky. Meanwhile, we pick apart the controversy of Champion Fairewood
       Frolic (registered name or called name: which counts?), go over
       the day's news (the day being February 18, 1998), and send two emails to
       Chip Davis's publicists. And best of all: website now secure! (Also featuring
       popular segment "The Set-Up".)
