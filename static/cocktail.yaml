       The Cocktail Gang gets "Wild Again" as we set off on a new podtail... or should
       we say "pod tale"! After all, we have a Whale of a Story to share with
       you: the story of brash, young, scared military man Brian Flanagan and his
       dreams of owning the city of New York, one spinning bottle of liquor at a
       time. New features are debuted: "Drink of the Ep", "Flair in the Air", and
       "Who Let the Spoilers Out?". We pick apart the film’s depiction of
       masculinity in the 1980s, fill you in on the latest news and gossip about
       Gilles Gothic, examine the roots of George W. Bush’s imperialist aims, and
       check up on your favorite Long Island City subway stops. As we’ve always
       said, there has to be a crossroad, a place to draw the line. And as
       always, we attempt to answer the question, "what is theirs and what is
       mine?" The answer may surprise you. Drink of the Ep: the Uncle Pat.
