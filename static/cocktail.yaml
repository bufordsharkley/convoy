       The Cocktail Gang gets "Wild Again" as we set off on a new podtail... or should
       we say "pod tale"! After all, we have a Whale of a Story to share with
       you: the story of brash, young, scared military man Brian Flanagan and his
       dreams of owning the city of New York, one spinning bottle of liquor at a
       time. New features are debuted: "Drink of the Ep", "Flair in the Air", and
       "Who Let the Spoilers Out?". We pick apart the film’s depiction of
       masculinity in the 1980s, fill you in on the latest news and gossip about
       Gilles Gothic, examine the roots of George W. Bush’s imperialist aims, and
       check up on your favorite Long Island City subway stops. As we’ve always
       said, there has to be a crossroad, a place to draw the line. And as
       always, we attempt to answer the question, "what is theirs and what is
       mine?" The answer may surprise you.

     cocktail:
       name: The Uncle Pat
       image: http://media.earfulofconvoy.com/earful/cocktail_cocktail_01.jpg
       recipe: |
         1.5 oz potcheen
         2 oz flat beer through rusty pipes
         0.5 oz grenadine

         Carve a dollar sign into rind of half a lime and garnish

         Served on the rocks in double old-fashioned glass.

             Beer prepared by leaving out two ounces of lowest grade beer at hand (Corona)
             to go flat for an hour, metallic taste aided by the addition of four pennies (which
             hopefully also contributed the kind of gunk that doubtless clings to every
             inch of Pat's Tavern). Ice added first, grenadine glopped on top, which
             immediately sunk to bottom. Lime was initially halved, then carved into with
             dollar sign, then squeezed to completion (juice discarded), finally put in an toaster
             oven for a few minutes. Nothing was stirred.

             The nose reeked of potcheen's weird melon-like funk. The first sip
             stung with sour and intense potcheen kick, evoking
             spoiled dairy and antiseptic, mellowed with the stale beer's texture of a
             stagnant creek. It's the kind of drink a Pat's Cavern patron would
             love, the punishing sort of drink that makes you feel that you
             *earned* your insobriety, and keeps you safe from the troubling
             notion that you may for a moment ever enjoy your life. The
             grenadine only comes into play late in the drink. At this point,
             all you have is the remainder of the ice, an overlarge lime rind,
             and the grenadine you never wanted in the first place. You indifferently
             try to sip it for a while, but eventually dump it out.

             From rusty pipes come terrible drinks. Potcheen should not be in
             anything. The Uncle Pat is bad.

        Outwork, outthink, outscheme, and outmanoeuvre: that's the strategy for the
        Cocktail Gang as we address the second five, as Brian Flanagan pursues other
        avenues and wears many ties.  We are introduced to the first of Coughlin’s
        Laws, and hear the chilling name of "McDougall" for the first time. A lot
        happens during this episode: the psychology of Uncle Pat is delved, logical
        positivism is assessed, and we even start a lawsuit! Along the way, we attempt
        to solve the mystery once and for all: did the Mets win the World Series in
        1969 or 1965? The movie "Cocktail" offers clues. New feature: "Coughlin’s
        Laws."

     cocktail:
       name: Big Apple Interview
       image: http://media.earfulofconvoy.com/earful/cocktail_cocktail_02.jpg
       recipe: |
         1.5 oz vodka
         0.5 oz apple juice
         2 oz seltzer
         Pernod float

         Stir, serve up in oversized cocktail glass.

         Garnish with atomic fireball candy, sliced if possible.

             For the record, it is *not* possible to slice atomic fireball candy.

             In capturing the airy lustrousness of the gray Manhattan interview
             rooms, Stoli was selected, which seemed to be adequately '80s
             glitzy. As someone who does not like vodka cocktails and does not
             like apple juice, it's uncanny how *good* this is―almost certainly
             the best drink of its kind. Both the apple juice and pernod swim
             faintly against the big nothingness of vodka and seltzer; strong
             flavors in small quantities, it gives you the impression of a noisy
             street-level hubbub wafting 30 floors up, at the threshold of
             audibility. (The apple in particular gives the drink a certain
             honest bulkiness.) As you make you way through, the outer layer of
             the atomic fireball dissolves, lending an unsubtle satire of the
             cutthroat business world: stick around long enough and you're
             ankle-deep in blood.

             I don't like vodka cocktails much but this one was OK. More subtle
             than expected. For best results let it sit a day until the Atomic
             Fireball fully dissolves.

        An episode with all the excitement of the Keynesian revolution... but
        wait, there's more! Brian Flanagan goes full frogman, concurrent with
        matriculation to the University of Toronto. He's slipping and sliding
        behind the bar, scoring big tips from the waitstaff and BIGGER tips
        from Douglas Coughlin. The cocktail gang analyze the terrible, terrible
        drinks of the 1980s that are screamed in Brian's direction, as well as the
        vacant heart of 1980s greed. What does it mean? Nothing! Also featuring
        "With Fresh Eyes", with DJ scuttle_toes.

        It's a Target Kids takeover this episode of Earful, as we lurk within
        internet-only radio signals under the cover of a volleyball game. We break
        down the fifth five minutes, from assessing business proposals, juggling
        pizza, to examining the forgotten B-side of the Big Bopper's biggest bop.
        Also featuring detailed economic analysis of the bartender game through a
        Georgist lens, andeven cameos from Trump AND Clinton! Guest for "With
        Fresh Eyes": Trevor Adamo, who has useful information on comics-related
        websites to visit.

        Prepare your epsom, calculate your epsom checksum, and relax with the sixth
        five minutes of Cocktail! Some powerful stuff this episode, as the Earful gang
        investigates Brian Flanagan's role in #pizzagate, makes wagers on the future of
        rice-washing AI, takes preliminary efforts to reach out to Heywood Gould (a
        nail-biting LIVE tweet!), and importantly, never, ever talks over the sound of
        a human voice. For what is a "podcast" if not a panopticon for us to watch and
        be watched? And really, what separates the prose of the Earful gang from the
        work of a yuppie poet?  ...and THAT'S the bottom line!
