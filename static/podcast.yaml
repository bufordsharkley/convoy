     description: "Alan and Hervey hit a disagreement: Alan thinks these five minutes are really boring, and Hervey thinks its #totallyonfleek. Birthday boy Rubber Duck has a certain Violet in the back of his cab, and Dirty Lyle is being called bad names over a CB radio (for some reason). We discuss the logic of Love Machine/Pigpen and Spider Mike's decision, and more. Hashtag spoiler alert!"

     description: "Calling all brawlers! We dive into the fist-scraping underworld of truckstop dust-ups. Rubber Duck and gang don't like to fight, but will do it if a certain Dirty Lyle baits them! And we don't like to fight about discussing the movie Convoy, but we will if disagreements arise in our movie analysis and we can't agree to disagree! Get ready for the most INVIGORATING five minutes you'll spend this side of Gatorade!"

     description: "Time to hit the reset button! The masters of the \"Sync\", Hervey and Alan, do the ol' time warp again, and remap the very boundaries of time itself! That is to say, they upgrade a poor-quality DVD to a high-quality Blu-Ray, and the time-stamp discrepancies are illuminating! We talk commentary tracks, what Sam would have wanted, and do a blow-by-blow for last week's fight that is boring beyond words!"

     description: "Time to break out your reading glasses! The paperback for Convoy (\"the biggest book ever\") has arrived, and you know what that means... Pageful of Convoy time! Duck is offering coffee to Melissa, as Dirty Lyle drives angrily for quite a while. This super-sized ep features cameos from Pizza Hut, Kate Middleton, Old Iguana, and a great deal on 22 liters of shells, and we have screenwriter B.W.L. Norton (in book form) to help us decode it all! And speaking of shells, Hervey has a bombshell that may change the way you view birthday boy Rubber Duck forever. Also featuring hit gameshow Guess the Pagecount!"

     description: "For those who found our podcast by checking the top search results for \"convoy podcast\" on DuckDuckGo, welcome to this happy place! Sad news today about the Princess, but we power on as Duck and the rest of the convoy powers on through a veritable dust bowl. Hosts Hervey and Alan are possibly caked up as they struggle to distinguish Pomp and Circumstance from La Marseillaise. Slightly more coherent dialogue about Convoy's role as an exploration of masculinity in the late '70s; Radcliffe girls will find much to like."
