Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly live and work blocks from each other on <a href="javascript:MM_openBrWindow('/www/cmp/photos/photo-14.html','photo','width=500,height=370')" onmouseover="window.status='View photo';return true" onmouseout="window.status='';return true"><img src="/www/files/photo14.gif" width="120" height="77" alt="You've Got Mail" border="1" vspace="6" hspace="8" align="left"></a>New York City's Upper West Side.  They both buy groceries at Zabars; they pick their coffee up at the same Starbucks; they roam the same charming streets.  Joe lives with a brilliant, hyperactive book editor, Patricia Eden (PARKER POSEY).  Kathleen lives with a passionate, erudite newspaper columnist, Frank Navasky (GREG KINNEAR).  Each believes life and love to be satisfactory -- until they meet each other in a computer chat room and begin conversing on e-mail.<br>
<br>
Under the electronic pseudonyms NY152 and Shopgirl, Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly find themselves confiding everything to their unseen computer correspondent -- everything except their actual identities.  <br>
<br>
As friendship warms into affection on the Internet, Fox opens his superstore, the latest in the national chain of Foxbooks, a few blocks from Kathleen Kelly's store, The Shop Around the Corner.  With its discounts, huge inventory and espresso bar, Foxbooks seems certain to put Kathleen's cozy neighborhood store out of business. <br>
<br>
Kathleen inherited her shop from her mother, and it's been <a href="javascript:MM_openBrWindow('/www/cmp/photos/photo-34.html','photo','width=500,height=370')" onmouseover="window.status='View photo';return true" onmouseout="window.status='';return true">
<img src="/www/files/photo34.gif" width="120" height="77" alt="You've Got Mail" border="1" vspace="6" hspace="8" align="right"></a>a community landmark for more than 40 years.  Now, with her legacy and livelihood about to be destroyed, she confides in the faceless friend she has come to trust and value -- NY152.  And Joe, who unexpectedly learns the identity of his unknown confidante, also discovers an unmistakable attraction to Kathleen in real life as well as on the computer screen.  But how can he reconcile the passionate, witty and kind Shopgirl with the guarded Kathleen who hates Joe and everything his store stands for?  How can he reveal himself without losing her?<br>
<br>
<b>You've Got Mail</b> also stars a gifted ensemble including JEAN STAPLETON, DAVID CHAPPELLE and STEVE ZAHN, who enliven the community of Upper West Side denizens who surround Joe and Kathleen.<br>
