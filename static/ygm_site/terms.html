    enhanced online experience for the visitor. Information tracked includes the type
    of browser being used by the visitor (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type
    of operating system (e.g., Macintosh, Windows) in use by the visitor and the
    domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider (e.g., America Online,
    Earthlink) . By having this information, web pages optimized for a particular

These tools can also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission.
