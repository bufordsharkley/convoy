       international time zones, cool movie studio logos, Jumper bedtimes and
       wakeup timeas, young Jumper (has a different face), all the ways that
       Young Jumper's snowglobe is bad, sister cities, and the Nokia N93.

       In episode 2 of Earful, get ready for less bumps, more jumps, as we answer all the
       big questions, such as: "Did I just teleport?" As long Mr Jumper hones his craft,
       we analyze David Rice's dad's police call, mopping logistics, a bunch of really cool
       posters, and the 2007 menu of Texas Chicken & Grill. We crack the case of the photograph
       of David Jumper-Rice and his mom.  Featuring new segments, "Extra Screw
       Time," "Jump Into Spoilers", and "Pageful of Jumper".

       In a "nightmare of an episode", we're recording unusually early, to catastrophic consequences! As the cock crows,
       we toil in the studio, bringing you sparkling analysis about the Jumper saga,
       in particular the third five minutes. In this episode, David Jumper asks to
       use the bathroom, acquires used tools, and eventually puts together a sick
       jumper pad. But wait... here comes the mysterious Roland! Also updates on the
       Cubecast project, crucial information about the Empire State Building observation
       decks, and plenty of content from The Good Book (aka "Jumper", by Steven Gould).

       The earful gang is back from their own globetrotting, bringing you a new
       episode of Jumper: in the fourth five, we bring you our award-winning
       investigative journalism, re-opening the Gregg Baker cold case, and blowing
       the lid off of alleged used tool stores in NYC. In our analysis, we're having
       flashbacks to Our Day So Far: we return to the Sphinx, hang ten in Fiji, dangle
       from large clocks, and namecheck Tanqueray at the Irish Embassy. Discussion on
       "what are scenes", more time zone talk, and thoughts on probable Paladin financing.
       Re-introducing popular segment "We Read te Tweets", and featuring new segments
       "The Extra News Section" and "Jump List".

       hit your brain like 1000 volts of electricity! In this ep, David
       Jumper-Rice has forgotten how to use doors, Toby is anticipating his
       birthday, and Roland is embracing his hatred for jumpers. Join us as we
       overcome some VLC woes, and break upon the riddle of the cryptic "burrito"

       it up on Morton Street, and Mark Kobold (aka Mark Goblin) announces the
       resurrection of the Rice Cake. If we move fast, we can make it to Rome

       bright flashing lights as well as the blinding Hayden glint to pick
       apart the eighth five minutes of Jumper, in which Millie wears cute
       socks, falls out of a bed, and David opens so many gates. We give

       sequence. Roland's got The Device, The Device has helpful hazardous
       materials warnings, Egypt/Michigan has a gnarly pressure differential, and
       Griffin has some very mean drawings of Diane Lane. One more thing: we all
       have a possible Ghostbuster Situation.  This episode also includes
       important information about the YouTube Original Series "Impulse: From the
       World of Jumper", the famous segment "March Towards 2018", and a musical
