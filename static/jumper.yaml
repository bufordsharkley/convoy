       wakeup timeas, young Jumper (has a different face), all the ways that
       Young Jumper's snowglobe is bad, sister cities, and the Nokia N93.

       In episode 2 of Earful, get ready for less bumps, more jumps, as we answer all the
       big questions, such as: "Did I just teleport?" As long Mr Jumper hones his craft,
       we analyze David Rice's dad's police call, mopping logistics, a bunch of really cool
       posters, and the 2007 menu of Texas Chicken & Grill. We crack the case of the photograph
       of David Jumper-Rice and his mom.  Featuring new segments, "Extra Screw
       Time," "Jump Into Spoilers", and "Pageful of Jumper".

     description: >
       In a "nightmare of an episode", we're recording unusually early, to catastrophic consequences! As the cock crows,
       we toil in the studio, bringing you sparkling analysis about the Jumper saga,
       in particular the third five minutes. In this episode, David Jumper asks to
       use the bathroom, acquires used tools, and eventually puts together a sick
       jumper pad. But wait... here comes the mysterious Roland! Also updates on the
       Cubecast project, crucial information about the Empire State Building observation
       decks, and plenty of content from The Good Book (aka "Jumper", by Steven Gould).

     description: >
       The earful gang is back from their own globetrotting, bringing you a new
       episode of Jumper: in the fourth five, we bring you our award-winning
       investigative journalism, re-opening the Gregg Baker cold case, and blowing
       the lid off of alleged used tool stores in NYC. In our analysis, we're having
       flashbacks to Our Day So Far: we return to the Sphinx, hang ten in Fiji, dangle
       from large clocks, and namecheck Tanqueray at the Irish Embassy. Discussion on
       "what are scenes", more time zone talk, and thoughts on probable Paladin financing.
       Re-introducing popular segment "We Read te Tweets", and featuring new segments
       "The Extra News Section" and "Jump List".

       The earful gang is back, caffeinated, ready with an episode that will
       hit your brain like 1000 volts of electricity! In this ep, David
       Jumper-Rice has forgotten how to use doors, Toby is anticipating his
       birthday, and Roland is embracing his hatred for jumpers. Join us as we
       overcome some VLC woes, and break upon the riddle of the cryptic "burrito"
       wrapper. Also featuring popular segment, "Continued updates".

       The earful gang is back, in what many are calling "the perfect fall ep!"
       In these five minutes, we skip the boring parts, as David Rice-Jumper
       hugs Millie's mom after a momentous knock-and-announce, Millie is living
       it up on Morton Street, and Mark Kobold (aka Mark Goblin) announces the
       resurrection of the Rice Cake. If we move fast, we can make it to Rome
       before this episode is up! (We do not make it to Rome). Also featuring
       popular segments "Don't Press Play", "Cast Notes", "Elephant in the Room",
       "Evolution of a Scene", and "We Weed the Tweets".
